### Backend

- Reorganized the search processing pipeline.
- Refactored the `/parse` endpoint for asynchronous parser execution.

## New Updates - v3.1.0

### What's Changed?

- Fully redesigned UI - minimalist dark theme with `#e8e8e8` accent
- Replaced gold color palette with neutral soft-white system
- Added animated search rings background (CSS-only, no JS)
- Improved input and button UX for mobile and desktop
- Rounded corners across all components (iPhone-style, 20px)
- Removed scrollbar globally for cleaner look
- Fixed search rings jitter on scroll using `will-change` and `translateZ(0)`
- Applied modern CSS: `@layer`, `@property`, `color-mix()`, `container queries`, `:has()`, `text-wrap: balance`
- Added `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` support for iOS notch devices
- Improved modal on tablet - now renders as bottom sheet
- Added `100dvh` for correct mobile viewport handling
- Added `touch-action: manipulation` and `min-height: 44px` on all interactive elements

### Context

The previous UI used a gold/yellow palette with hard borders and basic styling. This update brings the design in line with modern UI/UX standards - clean, minimal, dark, and mobile-first. No third-party UI libraries were used; everything is pure CSS.

### Checklist

- [x] Code is formatted (e.g., with `black`, `prettier`)
- [x] Tested locally
- [x] No temporary or debug code remains

### Testing

- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop)
- Tested on iOS Safari and Android Chrome (mobile)
- Verified modal bottom sheet behavior on tablet
- Verified search rings stay fixed on scroll without jitter
- Verified iOS zoom-on-focus is prevented (`font-size: 16px` on mobile input)

### Additional Notes

- Search rings are implemented via CSS pseudoelements on `body` and two empty `#rings`, `#rings2` divs in `index.html` - reviewers should be aware of these divs
- `@layer` order: `base → layout → components → states`
- `color-mix()` is used for hover states - check browser support if IE11 compatibility is needed (it's not supported there)

## 🪐 GRAND UPDATE v3.0.0 – Changes Overview

### Removed
- Aggressive mode from both frontend and backend.
- OpenLibrary API (no longer used for link fetching).
- Any UI components related to aggressive mode (e.g., `AggressiveModeToggle` in React).
- Yahoo search included only as a basic fallback; aggressive combined queries were removed.

### Added
- Integration with **Qwant API** (free search engine) for keyword-specific searches.
- Integration with **Hacker News API** to fetch relevant posts.
- Integration with **StackExchange API** to search questions and answers exactly matching keywords.
- **DuckDuckGo, Bing, Wikipedia, Reddit** remain as search sources.
- Frontend automatically sends keywords and language to backend without any aggressive mode parameters.
- Exact keyword search for all APIs where possible to improve relevance.

### Modified / Improved
- Refactored backend to synchronous requests (removed async) to simplify fetching from multiple APIs.
- Simplified frontend UI: removed aggressive mode toggle and related labels.
- Improved URL safety checks:
  - Validate scheme (`http/https`)
  - Block private, reserved, loopback, multicast IPs
  - Block localhost domains
- Standardized maximum links per keyword to 15 across all sources.
- Backend enforces keywords list ≤10 and keyword length ≤50 characters.
- Added safer `requests.Session()` usage for all API calls.
- Improved error handling for fetch failures (returns empty list instead of crashing).
- Limiting API calls: 10 requests per minute per client IP via Flask-Limiter.
- Frontend now sends only safe parameters (`keywords`, `lang`) and uses `Suspense` for lazy-loaded components.
- Reduced dependency on IP for safety (more focus on URL validity and safe parsing).
- All previous aggressive mode CSS / UI classes removed.

## 🌀 GRAND UPDATE v2.0.0 – Changes Overview

## 🔍 What’s Changed?

### Security Improvements:

* **Implemented URL safety validation**:

  * Blocked private IP ranges (`192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x`).
  * Blocked localhost addresses (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `::1`).
  * Blocked reserved, loopback, and multicast IPs.
  * Allowed only `http` and `https` URL schemes.

* **Added Input Validation**:

  * `keywords` must be a list.
  * Limited to **10 keywords per request**.
  * Each keyword must be a **string** and **no longer than 50 characters**.

* **Added Error Handling**:

  * All HTTP requests are wrapped with `try-except` to catch connection and parsing issues.
  * Prevented unexpected crashes if DuckDuckGo or Yahoo changes their page structure.

* **Added Request Rate Limiting**:

  * **Global** limit: **10 requests per minute**.
  * **/parse endpoint**: **5 requests per minute**.

### Technical Stack Used:

| Feature         | Library               | Purpose                               |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| SSRF Protection | `ipaddress`, `urllib` | Block unsafe network targets          |
| Rate Limiting   | `Flask-Limiter 3.12`  | Prevent DoS / abuse attacks           |
| HTML Parsing    | `BeautifulSoup`       | Safe scraping of search results       |
| HTTP Requests   | `requests`            | External requests with error handling |
| CORS Handling   | `flask_cors`          | Control allowed client origins        |

## Testing

* Verified SSRF protection with safe and unsafe URLs (e.g., private IPs, localhost).
* Simulated search engine structure changes to ensure graceful failure.
* Tested rate limiting behavior by sending rapid requests.
* Validated keyword input constraints and error messages.

## Additional Notes

Reviewers should focus on:

* URL safety logic correctness.
* Rate limiting thresholds.
* Keyword validation constraints.
* Error message consistency for client-side handling.
